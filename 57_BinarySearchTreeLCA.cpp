// For this challenge you will attempt to find the lowest common ancestor of a binary search tree.
/*
have the function BinarySearchTreeLCA(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain 3 elements: the first element will be a binary search tree with all unique values in a preorder traversal array, the second and third elements will be two different values, and your goal is to find the lowest common ancestor of these two values. For example: if strArr is ["[10, 5, 1, 7, 40, 50]", "1", "7"] then this tree looks like the following:



For the input above, your program should return 5 because that is the value of the node that is the LCA of the two nodes with values 1 and 7. You can assume the two nodes you are searching for in the tree will exist somewhere in the tree.
